      <h1 class="text-2xl mb-4">What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</h1>
      <p class="text-xl border-b-2">The meaning of DOM is - Document Object Model. Its Document 
        refers as file, objects refer as tags and elements and lastly model refers to layout structure.
        Dom represents the HTML document  as a tree structure. Its a programming interface or an API 
        which can be used by any programming language. Its also an object oriented representation of the web page 
        which can be easily modified by any scripting language such as javascript. By using DOM we can easily 
        access, read, update and change its content. Which is one of the huge advantage of DOM.

      <h1 class="text-2xl mb-4"> How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.</h1>
      <p class="text-xl ">In 5 ways we can select a HTML element by using DOM. Some selectors select 
        one element while some selectors selects all element. Here are 5 methods below to select an element - 
        <ul class="border-b-2 text-lg">
        <li>Single element by id: getElementById()</li>
        <li>Single element by css selector: querySelector()</li>
        <li>Multiple elements by css selector: querySelectorAll()</li>
        <li>Multiple elements by class: getElementsByClassName()</li>
        <li>Multiple elements by tag: getElementsByTagName()</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <br>
      <h1 class="text-2xl mb-4">What is event bubble?</h1>
      <p class="text-xl border-b-2">
        When an event happens on an element, it first runs the handlers on it, then on its parent, 
        then all the way up on other ancestors and it keeps going until it reaches to the top.This process is called bubbling, because events bubble from the inner 
        element up through parents like a bubble in the water. Let's say, 
        If there are two elements, element 1 and element 2. Element 2 is inside element 1 and we attach an event handler with both the elements lets say onClick.
        Now when we click on element 2 then eventHandler for both the elements will be executed. Now here in which order the event will execute.
        If the event attached with element 1 executes first it is called event capturing and if the event attached with element 2 executes first this is called 
        event bubbling. As per W3S the event will start in the capturing phase until it reaches the target comes back to the element and then it starts bubbling.
      </p>

      <h1 class="text-2xl mb-4">What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h1>
      <p class="text-xl border-b-2">
        In javascript function are objects, so we can send objects to function as parameter.
        So, we can also pass functions as parameters to other functions and call them inside 
        the outer functions. So a function that is passed to another function as a parameter is a callback function.
        In JavaScript, the way to create a callback function is to pass it as a parameter to another function, and then
        call it back right after something has happened or some task is completed.
        JavaScript runs code from top-down order but in some cases that code must run after something else happens and also not sequentially.
        Callbacks make sure that a function is not going to run before a task is completed but will run right after the task has completed. Thus makes the code safe from 
        problems and errors.
